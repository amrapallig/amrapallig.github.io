				Salt fingering is a mixing process, example of double diffusive instability, that occurs when relatively warm, salty water overlies 
				relatively colder, fresher water. It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of 
				warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water 
				increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced 
				upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to 
				rise further. Paradoxically, the fact that salinity diffuses less readily than temperature means that salinity mixes more efficiently than 
				temperature due to the turbulence caused by salt fingers <a href="https://www.planetwater.ca/research/oceanmixing/saltfingers.html"  alt=" under review" >Read more... </a>
